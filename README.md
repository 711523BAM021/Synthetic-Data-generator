# Synthetic-Data-generator
My project is a responsive web-based Synthetic Data Generator that creates high-quality artificial datasets while preserving data privacy. It uses CTGAN, a deep learning-based generative model designed for tabular data, to generate realistic synthetic datasets suitable for machine learning training and testing.
